# COMP20005
comp20005 Intro. to Numerical Computation in C Semester 1, 2024 Assignment 1

In this project you will demonstrate your understanding of loops, if statements, functions, and arrays;
writing a program that first reads some numeric data and then performs a range of processing tasks on
it. You may also make use of structures if you wish (Chapter 8). But there is no requirement for you to
make use of struct types, and the required tasks can equally well be carried out using a small number
of one-dimensional arrays.
